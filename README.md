### This is the code of my Master Thesis: System Design and Performance Evaluation for Semantic Communication with Large Language Model  
#### Environments  
You can install the environment by requirements.txt  
We use CUDA 12.1, pytorch 2.3.0, and python 3.8  

#### Checkpoints  
checkpoints of fine-tuning can be downloaded from:  
MS COCO: https://rwth-aachen.sciebo.de/s/eACUUDOzBFtVm74  
Flickr30k: https://rwth-aachen.sciebo.de/s/2OHVBKvgB1WXpox  
you can put the checkpoints at root/coco_ckpt and root/flickr_ckpt  
#### Run  
you can run the code at the files in root/run and switch datasets by importing various dataclasses in root/configs/dada
